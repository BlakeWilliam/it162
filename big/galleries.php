        There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of articles written about image galleries, but a ton of code examples everywhere to experiment with. This seems to suggest to me that the copious amount of variation in galleries styles and techniques that are chosen are something that is dependent on/rely on existing style choices of your project. There is a lack of opinion on what the best way to approach this is, other than “if you need one, use one”, appropriately of course.</p>
        <p>Something I did find very informative and in line with the way I've started to think about web development is that no matter what you choose, make sure it is responsive to a user’s device. The site ucidigital.com says, “The quickest way to lose a customer is poor compatibility with their device. You need to ensure that your website’s image gallery works across multiple devices and platforms. Always test it to make sure that none of your potential customers are excluded. Do this after every update.”</p>
        <p>There are very basic html image gallery codes available, but I feel that I will probably stay away from these basic galleries unless they can be adapted and integrated into a responsive one. In everything that I’ve been learning, in all of the classes so far, is that a main aspect that should never be overlooked in design or development is that whatever your project is, it should be both accessible and responsive.</p>
        <p>Light box, developed by Lokesh Dhakar, seems to be the most popular version of a gallery to use. This is also a beautiful interface that is simple and clean. I will probably try to implement this type of gallery. In fact - the example gallery you see on this page is an image gallery utilizing Lightbox 2!!!

 <h2>Key Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&#8649; Image galleries can vary from simple, trendy, sophisticated, code-heavy, or very technical. You really need to weigh your options toward what your brand (or purpose/aim) is really trying to convey. Use something that complements the style of the entire site as a whole.</li><br>
        <li>&#8649; Keep responsiveness in mind, pick something that is adaptable and responsive to all device sizes.</li><br>
        <li>&#8649; Light boxes are a very popular choice to consider.</li>
