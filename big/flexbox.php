    <p>Flexbox is a versatile tool that has changed the way developers have been able to organize their websites. The addition of flexbox to CSS has given us the ability to design responsive websites and have greater control of the alignment of element placement. With the advancement of our ability to control elements on our pages and the subsequent release of the grid, it has come to light that there are times when flexbox is not the appropriate solution. Leonardo Maldonado of the Log Rocket blog says, “Back in that time when Flexbox was released, we thought that it could be the best layout system to use to build our web pages, but it wasn’t.” He goes on to make the case that although it is a powerful tool, you should be weary about using flexbox as your main solution to whole layouts for a site.</p>
    <p>He, and other writers, have pointed out that flexbox is a one dimensional solution so it still has some limitations that could create more complicated coding where the use of a grid could ease those complications as it is a 2 dimensional alignment solution. Saying this means that one-dimensional flexbox can only control one axis at a time (rows OR columns) whereas two dimensional grids can handle both axis at the same time (rows AND columns). This is why proponents suggest using grid in layouts, and flexbox for content.</p>
    <p>So I’ve learned a few ways of optimal usage on when to use flexbox. I will definitely be looking into utilizing flexbox into my designs in portions of my code like certain containers on my layout that contain content. I will be conscious of the pros and cons, and try to use flexbox appropriately to help keep my code clean, and to maintain ease for future developers who may need to use my code to maintain a site after me. Being aware of the best use will help me make mistakes or over complicated solutions, and also by keeping me up to date on standards I’ll be able to follow and understand emerging tech and web coding practices.</p>
