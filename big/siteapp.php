<p>The time spent on mobile devices has grown considerably in the last 10 years. So should you design a responsive web app or build a native app? From digging around the web, it really seems that the answer is not a simple one. People should first consider what the point of the web app/native app is trying to accomplish. There may be a case for just a web app if the point is just to convey information. But if monetization (in various ways) is more of the key point, then a native app to house and simplify transactions could be more appropriate.</p>
	<p>I think a good place to start is to make use of a responsive web app first. Find your information architecture, and most important features and distill that into a responsive layout. If there seems to be more features needed, or the desire/need to build in more technical interactive elements, then developing an app should be considered. This way you will always have a responsive web app to hold your company/products’s online identity no matter what., If a native app is then developed, then you can adapt it to further the brand identity and include other feature possibilities that aren’t otherwise possible through HTML 5, CSS, and javascript alone.</p>
